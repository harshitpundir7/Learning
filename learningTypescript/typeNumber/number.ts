// we can define the varible as a number in two for first one is this 

let userId: number = 2660;
userId.toFixed();

// but if we wants to do some operation on the variable we declared then the better way to declare th number is this

let userNumber = 8546;
userNumber.toFixed();

// in this typscript automatically defined the type of the variable user userName

// if you are seeing the error in th code then just ignore them we will fix them in further learning
